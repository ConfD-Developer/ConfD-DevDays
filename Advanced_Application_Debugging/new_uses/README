control socket timeout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example illustrates how a control socket timeout 
can occur for an exit of a session that is completly 
unrelated to a ongoing transaction.

Do:

$ make clean all start

[Terminal 1]
$ confd_cli 

[Terminal 2]
$ confd_cli


In terminal 1 do some configurations. 

> configure
% set servers server server1 ip 1.1.1. port 1
% commit

Within 10 seconds close the session started in terminal 2

[terminal 2]
> exit 

You'll encounter a control socket timeout see logs/devel.log
