A ConfD Performance Measurement Demo
=====================================================

Run a NETCONF networkwide transaction to from NSO to multiple ConfD
instances that have the NETCONF capabilities :rollback-on-error, :candidate, 
:confirmed-commit:1.1, and :validate:1.1 enabled and while
:writable-running is discabled.

Prerequisites
-------------

NSO and ConfD installation files, ConfD's libconfd tar-ball,
and Docker installed.

See setup.sh, Dockerfile, and router_nso/run.sh in that order for an overview.

Steps
-----
1. NSO and ConfD installation files, ConfD's libconfd tar-ball.
2. Change the version variables in the setup.sh file to reflect your
NSO and ConfD installation file versions.

3. Run the demo

$ ./setup.sh

Side note: The demo setup get the YANG models from the devices and use the 
NSO>=5.2 NETCONF NED builder or the Pioneer package for NSO<5.2 to build the 
NED representation of the three ConfD enalbed "routers" in this demo. 


4. Create a nano service according to the README in NSOs nano service example.
See output for an overview of what the resulting NSO RPCs are in NETCONF XML,
the progress logs for NSO and the ConfD instances and the resulting configuration
change in the ConfD instances printed in XML from a subscriber that get the 
configuration using cdb_get_modifications()

5. To trigger a rollback of the confirmed commit, start the "abort in 
prepare phase" application on for example router2 (ConfD IPC port 4575) 

$Â docker exec -it confd-trans-demo ./tools/confd_cmd -p 4575 -c "subwait_abort2 /sys 1 1" 

6. Change something in the nano service that result in a changed configuration in all 
devices. See log output for and look for the "artificial abort".
