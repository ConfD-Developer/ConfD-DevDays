A ConfD Performance Measurement Demo
====================================

Run a performance measurement demo where a MAAPI load and save config + a 
NETCONF <get-config> is performed. One shell script print out the result
in wall clock time and the other monitor the cpu load and RAM memory RSS 
and high watermark usage. The former shell script also push the result to
the Prometheus Push Gateway that is scraped by Prometheus. Grafana is used
to visiualize the results that was uploaded to Prometheus using a "ConfD
Performance Measurement Demo Dashboard". The Prometheus node explorer is 
also enabled together with the Grafana node explorer dashboard. All components
run in a Docker container for demo purposes. 

See setup.sh, Dockerfile, pushgw-confd-testrun.sh, pushgw-confd-monitor.sh in 
that order for an overview of the setup and execution of the demo.

Prerequisites
-------------

ConfD installer, ConfD libconfd tar-ball, and Docker.

Steps
-----
1. Add the ConfD installer and ConfD's libconfd tar-ball to where you unpacked the 
demo. 
2. Change the version variables in the setup.sh file to reflect your ConfD installer 
version.
3. Run the demo

$ ./setup.sh

4. Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:3000/ to run Grafana.

5. Login with tailf as user and pass. 

6. The Grafana home screen show that Prometheus has been pre-configured as the data 
source and that there are two dashboards, the ConfD performance measurement demo
dashboard and the Prometheus node explorer dashboard. 

On the ConfD demo dashboard, the gauges show the current ConfD process CPU and 
RAM memory usage, including a RAM memory high watermark for the current test run. 
The two time-mode graphs below the gauges show the same metrics for the past 5 
minutes. The three bottom time-mode graphs show the wall clock time, RAM memory high
watermark and RSS memory at the end of each test run. 

Each test run will start ConfD, load N number of list entries as configuration data an XML file 
using maapi_load_config(), and then read the configuration data in XML format using
maapi_save_config() and NETCONF <get-config>.

Bonus: See the ConfD progress.trace files from each test run for details on the read and 
write transaction timings as performed by the ConfD transaction manager.

$ docker exec -it confd-pm bash
$ ls progress*.trace
$ cat progress<12345>.trace
